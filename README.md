# Hoshina Anniversary – Kanade

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Confused by the sound of someone else
I'm dancing
Concluded at night my sweet dance
Compliment
It was not me
Then who was it?
Who is dancing?
No, my own dance
I think that's what people want
Floating
Floating out of my life
Cheat with makeshift dance
Not my way
Voices inside my head chase me
I make it sing
One more dance.
```
